      <h2 class="cs-title">The Story of Childhood Cancer Society</h2>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Welcome to the Childhood Cancer Society (CCS), a sanctuary of hope and a
        testament to the power of family support during challenging times. Our
        journey began through the eyes of a compassionate 7-year-old, Tommy
        Head, who understood deeply the significance of familial comfort while
        undergoing evaluations for childhood leukemia. This profound experience
        catalyzed the creation of CCS, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization
        dedicated to empowering families touched by pediatric cancer.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Tommy’s personal health challenges led to a period of restricted
        physical activity, during which he discovered a passion for acting. His
        talents shone through in numerous commercials, print advertisements, and
        television roles, including appearances on ABC’s “One Life to Live,”
        culminating in his induction into the Screen Actors Guild (SAG). At the
        tender age of 12, Tommy channeled his earnings from acting into a
        heartfelt donation of video game consoles to the hospital that supported
        him, sparking joy and respite for many young patients.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        Emboldened by his full recovery at age 15 and a renewed zest for life,
        Tommy transformed his gratitude into action by founding CCS. Our
        organization is volunteer-driven, channeling generosity and support to
        provide financial assistance and emotional encouragement to families
        navigating the journey of pediatric cancer.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
        In 2019, CCS introduced a beacon of courage and joy: Adventure Ted. As
        the superhero and official spokes-bear of our society, Adventure Ted
        embodies the resilience and compassion at the heart of our mission. He
        inspires both the young and the young-at-heart to rise above adversities
        and extend a helping hand to others in their own quests.
      </p>
      <p class="cs-text">
