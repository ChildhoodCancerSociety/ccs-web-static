      Adventure Ted Chats is a guest speaker series that invites prominent
      individuals to share challenges/pivotal moments in their lives, the wisdom
      they’ve gained through those experiences, and how those challenges/moments
      brought them to what they’re doing today. Whether the challenges discussed
      pertain to childhood cancer, or the long journey to a dream career, each
      episode consists of an authentic conversation between a featured speaker
      and the Founder/CEO of Childhood Cancer Society, Tommy Head. This series
      is premiering for Childhood Cancer Awareness month (September 2023).
      Beginning September, be sure to tune in every Monday for a guest speaker’s
      trailer, and every Thursday to watch a new episode! Check out more about
      our upcoming guest speakers and each episode below:
